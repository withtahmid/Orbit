/**
 * Enforce that `space_id` on a transaction is a meaningful tag: the
 * chosen space must share at least one of the transaction's accounts,
 * otherwise the row is orphaned — it would live on a space that has
 * no visibility into either leg. Under the account-flow analytics
 * model (see spec §12), `space_id` becomes a categorization /
 * organizational hint rather than a scope boundary, so this invariant
 * keeps the tag honest without constraining legitimate cross-space
 * contributions (where one leg is shared into the recording space and
 * the other isn't).
